## Directory Structure

- **`src`**  
  Contains implementations of various projects.

- **`pseudo_code`**  
  Pseudo code of my implementations.

- **`blog`**  
  Shares my thoughts and notes on some interesting projects.

- **`test`**  
  My own test code written using the [Unity Test Framework](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity).

- **`manual_test`**  
  Includes manual tests for functions that couldn't be tested using Unity in Hiveâ€™s environment.

- **`online_test`**  
  Contains online testing tools. Thanks to the authors for providing beautiful UIs and extensive corner cases!  
  I run these tests before submission, and occasionally, some test cases inspire thoughts about what might be considered appropriate error handling.

- **`pdfs`**  
  Contains project requirements and instructions.

- **`.vscode`**  
  Configuration files for VSCode.

## Projects

### **Zone 0**

#### **`libft`**  
This project, similar to the Piscine experience, implements essential utility functions.  
The bonus task focuses on implementing a linked list.  
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/libft)

---

### **Zone 1**

#### **`ft_printf`**  
This project implements a `printf` function.  
The bonus part involves supporting additional parameters, which I have not implemented.  
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/ft_printf)

#### **`get_next_line`**  
An interesting projects!  
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/get_next_line)  
- [My Thoughts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/blog/get_next_line.md)

#### **`born2_be_root`**
Just to launch a virtual machine.
- [Scripts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/born2_be_root)

### **Zone 2**

#### **`push_swap`**
Sorting by 2 stacks, practical Greedy, BFS, Circular Doubly Linked List, and Dependency Injection
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/push_swap)  
- [My Thoughts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/blog/push_swap.md)

#### **`so_long`**
A 2D game like `Pacman`, practical Object Oriented Programming, and Dependency Injection
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/so_long)  
- [My Thoughts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/blog/so_long.md)

#### **`pipe_x`**
Implements an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to handle pipes, redirections, and commands in a binary tree structure, utilizing polymorphism in C.
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/pipe_x) 
- [My Thoughts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/blog/pipex.md)

---

### **Zone 3**

#### **`philosophers`**
A concurrent programming challenge, implemented with a State Machine and a simple Synchronized Message Queue.
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/src/philo/philo)
- [My Thoughts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42cursus/tree/main/blog/philosopher.md)

#### **`mini_shell`**
A simplified version of the Linux shell that follows the POSIX protocol.
 - Implemented a State Machine and a very simplified `vector` for `parser`.
 - Used an Abstract Syntax Tree with mixed pre-order and post-order travelsal for `executor`.
- [Implementation](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42-minishell)
- [My Thoughts](https://github.com/danielxfeng/42-minishell/blob/main/README.md)
